## Description:
-This repository contains files used for processing, training, and scoring data from the Cars93, Wine, and Titanic datasets. The purpose of this repository was to do a deep dive in a specific machine learning algorithm: Random Forest. This repository also contains visuals that show the Random Forest algorithm and other machine learning algorithms such as linear regression.

## Collaborators:
- Will Crocker
- Sam Moe
- Adi Palapati

## Analysis Overview
In this project we set out to further our understanding of machine learning algorithms by the use of Random Forest its capabilities. We set out to answer the following questions:
1. What is the Random Forest algorithm and how does it work?
2. What are the advantages of Random Forest?
3. Wheat are the disadvantages of Random Forest?
4. What types of datasets best suit the use of Random Forest?
5. Are there any hyperparameters or jargon associated with Random Forest?

## Contributions:
#### Sam Moe: 
-Worked on the Wine DataSet and visuals with collaborators 
-Did research on Advantages and Disadvantages
#### Will Crocker:
-Worked on the Cars93 DataSet with collaborators 
-Did research of Jargon, usablity, and target Datasets 
#### Adi Palapati:
-Worked on the Titanic DataSet and visuals 
-Did research on hyperparameters and find useful resources
